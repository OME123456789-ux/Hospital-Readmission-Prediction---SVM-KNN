# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Prediction - SVM & KNN

This project predicts **hospital readmission** using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. It includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and real-time user predictions** based on hospital stay details.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛠 Features

✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\
✅ **EDA & Visualizations** (Heatmaps, Histograms, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)\
✅ **KNN & SVM Hyperparameter Tuning** (Grid & Random Search)\
✅ **Model Performance Comparison** (Accuracy & Confidence Scores)\
✅ **User Input Testing** (Predict Readmission in Real-Time)

## 🔬 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈

## 🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hospital_Readmission_Prediction.git
```

2️⃣ Open `Hospital_Readmission_SVM_KNN.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook\
3️⃣ Run the notebook to train models and test real-time predictions

## 📀 Results & Insights

- **SVM generally performs better than KNN** based on accuracy and confidence scores.
- **Final predictions** are based on model accuracy and confidence levels.
